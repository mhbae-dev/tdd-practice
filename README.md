# TDD Practice

This repository serves as a record of my journey in Test-Driven Development (TDD). In this repository, you will find a collection of code examples and exercises that I have worked on as I have been learning and practicing TDD. Each example or exercise is in its own directory, and includes a README.md file with a brief description of what the code does and what I learned from working on it.

## What is Test-Driven Development (TDD)?

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development methodology that emphasizes writing automated tests before writing the actual code. The TDD process involves the following steps:

1. Write a test that describes the desired behavior of the code.
2. Run the test and verify that it fails.
3. Write the minimum amount of code necessary to pass the test.
4. Run the test again and verify that it passes.
5. Refactor the code to improve its design and maintainability, while ensuring that all tests still pass.

By following this process, developers can create code that is more reliable, maintainable, and resilient to change.
